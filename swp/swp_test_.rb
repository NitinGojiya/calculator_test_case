# The formula for a Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) calculator is:
#  A = PMT * ((1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1) / (r/n), where:
# A: is the estimated final investment value.
# PMT: is the withdrawal amount per period (e.g., monthly).
# r: is the annual rate of return.
# n: is the compounding frequency per year (e.g., 12 for monthly).
# t: is the investment duration in years.

1000 * ((1 + 0.12/1)**(1*1) - 1) / (0.12/1)


# A = PMT ((1+r/n)^nt-1)/(r/n))

# Where:
# 'A' is the final value of your investment
# 'PMT' is the withdrawal amount per period
# 'n' is compounding frequency
# 't' is the investment duration

# Consider this example:
# Initial Investment amount: Rs. 10,00,000
# SWP tenure: 5 years â€¢ Desired monthly withdrawal: Rs. 20,000
# Expected Rate of Return: 12%

20000 * ((1+0.12/12)**(12*5-1))/(0.12/12)
